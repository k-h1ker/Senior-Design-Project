This is my senior deisgn project. My group was tasked with developing machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict wine samples given their spectral data.
I personally contributed to the partial least squares algorithm, which was written in Python in a Linux environment. The neural network and data preprocessing were done by the other members of my group
